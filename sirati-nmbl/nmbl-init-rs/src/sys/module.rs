//! Kernel module loading via `finit_module(2)`, with a dep-graph
//! resolver fed by `<modules_dir>/<release>/modules.dep`.
//!
//! This is the moral replacement of the `modprobe` invocation in the
//! bash `mount-and-kernel.sh.nix`. It deliberately does not shell out.

// Parser, resolver, and loader land in follow-up commits.
